# Gender-Bias-in-Science-and-Technical-field
This project aims to investigate gender bias in science and technical fields using Tableau, a data visualization tool. 
The project will involve collecting data related to gender representation, pay gaps, and career progression for individuals in STEM fields.

The cleaned data will be imported into Tableau and transformed into visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to gain insights into gender bias in STEM fields. 
The visualizations will provide an overview of gender representation, pay gaps, and career progression in various STEM fields.

The findings of the analysis will be presented in a report format, which will include the Tableau visualizations, key insights, and recommendations for improvement. 
The report will highlight the gender-based barriers to career progression, pay gaps, and underrepresentation of women in certain STEM fields.

Overall, the project will help to raise awareness of gender bias in science and technical fields and provide recommendations for creating a more inclusive and equitable
environment for individuals in STEM fields. The project will also demonstrate the importance of data analysis and visualization in uncovering patterns and trends in 
complex datasets.
